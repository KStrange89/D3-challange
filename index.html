          <h2>Correlations Discovered</h2>
          <p>By using the axis options given, you can look at a comparison between any two of the options. Some, like obesity v smokes,
            have a strong correlation. While others, like age v income, have a weaker correlation.
          </p>

          <p>This is not all together surprising as people of all ages live in poverty and studies show that of the many health risks
            caused by smoking, obesity is one. While correlation does not imply causation, in this case, there is sufficient evidence
            from scientically sound studies that shows that smoking causes obesity. However, one must not look past the converse
            statement. Are obese people more likely to begin smoking? According to 
            <a href = "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180516184933.htm">ScienceDaily</a>, the answer is yes. The biconditionality
            of these studies indicates an extremely strong correlation between smoking and obesity. The reason this correlation is not even 
            stronger can be traced to genetics and life choices. 
          </p>

          <p>These are just two examples of the information provided by these graphs. Feel free to view all of the graphs and 
            conduct further research of your own to better understand the correlations among these life factors.
